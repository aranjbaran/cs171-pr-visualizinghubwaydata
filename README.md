readme

This github repository contains code on two branches for visualizing Hubway data. The master branch contains the code and libraries for the visualization and the gh-pages branch is a copy of the master branch and provides a way to host the webpage that we created for the visualization. The code are all files that are html and js, the libraries are in the libraries folder, such and bootstrap, hopscotch, chosen, among others. The main visualization is contained in bikemap1.html, with links to the JavaScript files that create the visualizations, mapvis, pievis, countvis, and uservis, primarily.
